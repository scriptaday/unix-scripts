# unix-scripts
The "(1)scriptaday" project was founded with the purpose to be a public archieve of automatic installation scripts which can easily be applied to your Unix Server.

Simply download a script and execute it on your server.

This is a non profit project and powered by the contributions of each individual taking part in it. Please feel free to contribute any automatic installation scripts you consider useful to stock up our resources :)
